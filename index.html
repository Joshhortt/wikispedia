            <p><a href="#"><strong>The fulvous whistling duck</strong></a> (Dendrocygna bicolor) is a tropical and subtropical bird in the family of ducks, geese and swans. It breeds in much of <a href="#">Mexico</a> and <a href="#">South America</a>, the <a href="#">West Indies</a>, the southern US, <a href="#">sub-Saharan Africa</a> and the <a href="#">Indian subcontinent</a>. It has mainly reddish brown <a href="#">plumage</a>, long legs and a long grey bill, and shows a distinctive white band across its black tail in flight. Like other members of its ancient lineage, it has a whistling call. The preferred <a href="#">habitat</a> is shallow lakes, <a href="#">paddy fields</a> or other <a href="#">wetlands</a> with plentiful vegetation. The nest, placed among dense vegetation or in a tree hole, typically holds around ten whitish eggs, which hatch in 24–29 days. The downy grey ducklings leave the nest within a day or so of hatching, but the parents continue to protect them until they fledge around nine weeks later. The fulvous whistling duck feeds in wetlands by day or night on seeds and other parts of plants. It has a huge range and is not threatened, despite hunting, poisoning by <a href="#">pesticides</a> and natural predation by mammals, birds and reptiles. <a href="#">Full article...</a></p>

        <p>Since their first mission in June 2010, rockets from the Falcon 9 family have been launched 51 times. Of these, 49 missions were successful, ISS cargo vessel CRS-7 was destroyed in flight, and one mission placed Dragon CRS-1 in the correct orbit but failed to deliver a secondary payload. Additionally, one rocket exploded on the launch pad in a pre-flight test, destroying the Amos-6 satellite. Designed and operated by private manufacturer SpaceX, the Falcon 9 rocket family includes the retired versions Falcon 9 v1.0, v1.1 and v1.2 "Full Thrust", the current "Full Thrust Block 4" upgrade and Falcon Heavy, and the in-development Falcon 9 Block 5. The Falcon design features reusable first-stage boosters, landing either on a ground pad near the launch site, or on a drone ship at sea. Falcon 9 was the first rocket to land propulsively after delivering a payload to orbit. This achievement is expected to significantly reduce launch costs. (Full list...)</p>

         <p>An 1884 illustration by Carlo Cornaglia of the Milan premiere of Don Carlos. This grand opera, composed by Giuseppe Verdi to a French-language libretto by Joseph Méry and Camille du Locle, is adapted from Friedrich Schiller's dramatic play Don Carlos and tells the conflicts of Carlos, Prince of Asturias (1545–1568). First performed in 1867, the opera exists in numerous versions, the longest of which lasts four hours.</p>
